Detailed Explanation of Each Step in Your LSTM Model
Your LSTM-based stock price predictor follows these steps for processing data, training the model, and making predictions. Let's go through each step in detail.
________________________________________
1Ô∏è‚É£ Load Data ‚Äì Reads Stock Price CSV File
‚úÖ Purpose:
‚Ä¢	The first step is to load the stock market dataset from a CSV file.
‚Ä¢	This dataset includes historical stock prices such as Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.
‚úÖ Process:
‚Ä¢	Use Pandas (pd.read_csv) to read the dataset into a DataFrame.
‚Ä¢	Set the 'Date' column as an index to work with time-series data.
‚úÖ Example Dataset Structure:
Date	Open	High	Low	Close	Volume
2024-01-01	100	105	98	102	500000
2024-01-02	102	107	101	104	520000
‚úÖ Why It‚Äôs Important?
‚Ä¢	Loading the dataset is the foundation for training the LSTM model.
‚Ä¢	A properly formatted dataset ensures accurate training and predictions.
________________________________________
2Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocess Data ‚Äì Handle Missing Values & Normalize Data
‚úÖ Purpose:
‚Ä¢	Raw stock data may have missing values or outliers that can affect model training.
‚Ä¢	The stock prices vary significantly, so we normalize the data between 0 and 1 for better training.
‚úÖ Process:
‚Ä¢	Handle Missing Values:
o	If any column has missing values, we fill them with the previous value (df.fillna(method='ffill')).
o	If there are still NaN values, we drop the rows (df.dropna()).
‚Ä¢	Feature Scaling (Normalization):
o	Uses MinMaxScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.
o	Scales stock prices between 0 and 1 using the formula: X‚Ä≤=X‚àíXminXmax‚àíXminX' = \frac{X - X_{\text{min}}}{X_{\text{max}} - X_{\text{min}}}X‚Ä≤=Xmax‚àíXminX‚àíXmin
o	This ensures the model learns efficiently without being biased towards large numbers.
‚úÖ Why It‚Äôs Important?
‚Ä¢	Preprocessing removes errors from data and makes it easier for LSTM to process.
‚Ä¢	Normalization speeds up training and improves prediction accuracy.
________________________________________
3Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Data ‚Äì Create 60-Day Sequences for LSTM Input
‚úÖ Purpose:
‚Ä¢	LSTMs require sequential data for time-series forecasting.
‚Ä¢	The model needs past 60 days of prices to predict the next day‚Äôs price.
‚úÖ Process:
‚Ä¢	Convert the Close price column into a NumPy array.
‚Ä¢	Create sequences of 60 previous stock prices and assign them as input (X_train).
‚Ä¢	Assign the next day's price as output (Y_train).
‚Ä¢	Reshape data into the format (samples, 60, 1) for LSTM input.
‚úÖ Example:
‚Ä¢	Input (X_train - last 60 days): [102, 104, 108, 110, 107, ...]
‚Ä¢	Output (Y_train - next day's price): 112
‚úÖ Why It‚Äôs Important?
‚Ä¢	LSTMs learn patterns from past stock prices to predict the next day's price.
‚Ä¢	Creating sequences ensures better forecasting accuracy.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Build Model ‚Äì Use LSTM Layers & Dense Layers
‚úÖ Purpose:
‚Ä¢	Define an LSTM neural network to process time-series stock data.

‚Ä¢	Dense Layer (25 Neurons) ‚Üí Fully connected layer to process extracted features.
‚Ä¢	Output Layer (1 Neuron) ‚Üí Predicts stock price for the next day.
‚Ä¢	Optimizer: Adam ‚Üí Adjusts learning rate dynamically.
‚Ä¢	Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) ‚Üí Minimizes prediction error.
‚úÖ Why It‚Äôs Important?
‚Ä¢	LSTM layers remember past trends and patterns in stock prices.
‚Ä¢	The Dense layer refines extracted features for better predictions.

‚úÖ Process:
‚Ä¢	Train the model using:
o	Batch Size: 1 (updates after each sample).
o	Epochs: 10 (can increase for better accuracy).
o	Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
‚úÖ Why It‚Äôs Important?
‚Ä¢	Training helps the LSTM learn trends in stock prices.
‚Ä¢	The model gets better at predicting future prices over multiple epochs.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Predict Prices ‚Äì Forecast Stock Prices on Test Data
‚úÖ Purpose:
‚Ä¢	Use the trained LSTM model to predict stock prices for unseen data.
‚úÖ Process:
‚Ä¢	Pass test data sequences into the trained LSTM model.
‚Ä¢	Model outputs predictions for future stock prices.
‚Ä¢	Reverse scaling to convert predictions back to original price values.
‚úÖ Why It‚Äôs Important?

________________________________________
7Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate Accuracy ‚Äì Use RMSE (Lower is Better)
‚úÖ Purpose:
‚Ä¢	Measure how well the model predicts stock prices.
‚Ä¢	Lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = Better Accuracy.
‚úÖ Formula:
‚úÖ Why It‚Äôs Important?
‚Ä¢	RMSE tells us how much the predictions deviate from actual prices.
‚Ä¢	Lower RMSE means better predictions and a more reliable model.
